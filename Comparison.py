#Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming languag
#Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.It can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code
#python-tabulate is used for printing readable presentation of mixed textual and numeric data: smart column alignment, configurable number formatting, alignment by adecimal point
#The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.class datetime.datetime ==> A combination of a date and a time. Attributes: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond, and tzinfo.
#Plotly's Python graphing library makes line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts.
